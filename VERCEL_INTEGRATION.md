# Vercel Integration Guide for Hadirku QR Portal

This guide explains how to deploy your Hadirku QR Portal to Vercel while ensuring it works properly with the Android app.

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push your project to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

2. Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and create a new account or sign in

3. Click "Add New..." > "Project"

4. Select your Git repository

5. Configure your project:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

6. Under "Environment Variables", add any required environment variables:
   - No sensitive information is currently needed for this project, as it uses localStorage

7. Click "Deploy"

## Connecting Android App to Vercel Deployment

Once your app is deployed to Vercel, you need to update the Android app configuration:

1. Open `capacitor.config.ts`

2. Update the `server.url` to your Vercel deployment URL:

```typescript
server: {
  url: "https://your-hadirku-qr-portal.vercel.app",
  cleartext: true
}
```

3. Rebuild and sync your Capacitor project:

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync
```

4. Test the Android app to ensure it's connecting to the Vercel deployment

## Database Considerations

Since this app currently uses localStorage for data storage:

- Web app users will have their own isolated data on their browser
- Android app users will have their own isolated data on their device
- There is no data sharing between devices or with the web version

For a production app, consider:

1. Implementing a proper backend database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
2. Creating API endpoints for data access
3. Updating both web and Android apps to use these APIs
4. Implementing authentication to secure data access

## Future Improvements

To create a true cross-platform experience:

1. Implement a backend server with a real database
2. Create REST or GraphQL APIs for data access
3. Update the `dbService.ts` to use these APIs instead of localStorage
4. Implement user authentication and data synchronization
5. Consider using Supabase or Firebase for easier backend setup
